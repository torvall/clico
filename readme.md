# Clico, the AI infused CLI companion

This is Clico, a **CLI CO**mpanion tool that enables you to use AI to manipulate output, recommend commands
or query an LLM using contextual data from your shell history and output.

It's designed to allow complex operations in data to be described using natural language, serve as a copilot in
your shell to help you develop or debug, or as a troubleshooting tool. Can also be used in automation.

***⚠️ WARNING: Clico can automatically execute commands generated by the LLM. Use with caution.***


## Usage

Clico can work in three different ways:

* `clico pipe` - takes the data from stdin and feeds it to the LLM together with the prompt
* `clico run` - generates a command line from a natural language prompt, and optionally executes it
* `clico explain` - takes the data from stdin and runs it through the LLM along with a specific question

## Examples

### Processing data (`pipe` mode)

```sh
$ ls -l | clico pipe "print table with just mode, size and name columns in json format" | jq
[
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 43,
    "name": "Makefile"
  },
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 148,
    "name": "flags.go"
  },
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 185,
    "name": "go.mod"
  },
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 2297,
    "name": "go.sum"
  },
  ...
]
```

### Figuring out the right command (`run` mode)

```sh
$ clico run "list all .go files in the current directory and their sizes"
ls -l *.go | awk '{print $9, $5}'
$ clico run --execute "list all .go files in the current directory and their sizes"
executing `ls -l *.go | awk '{print $9, $5}'`:
api.go 1372
cmd_explain.go 2156
cmd_pipe.go 2074
cmd_run.go 1912
main.go 2519
```

### Getting help with errors (`explain` mode)

```sh
$ cat /etc/sudoers
cat: /etc/sudoers: Permission denied
$ cat /etc/sudoers 2>&1 | clico explain "what does this mean?"
The command "cat" was used to try and display the contents of the file "/etc/sudoers", but it failed because the user running the command doesn't have permission to access that file. The error message indicates that the file is protected by sudo, which means only users with superuser privileges can read or modify its contents.
```

## Installing

At the moment, there's no prebuilt binaries available for download. You'll need to build from source:

```sh
go get -u github.com/torvall/clico
```

## TODO

* Add a system prompt
* Expose more model options (context size, top_k/top_p, etc.)
* Add ANSI support
* Support more providers like OpenAI
