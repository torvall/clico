# Clico, the AI infused CLI companion

This is Clico, a **CLI CO**mpanion tool that enables you to use AI to manipulate output, recommend commands
or query an LLM using contextual data from your shell history and output.

It's designed to allow complex operations in data to be described using natural language, serve as a copilot in
your shell to help you develop or debug, or as a troubleshooting tool. Can also be used in automation.

***⚠️ WARNING: Clico can automatically execute commands generated by the LLM. Use with caution.***

## Examples

### Processing data

```sh
# ls -l | clico pipe -p "print table with just mode, size and name columns in json format" | jq
[
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 43,
    "name": "Makefile"
  },
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 148,
    "name": "flags.go"
  },
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 185,
    "name": "go.mod"
  },
  {
    "mode": "-rw-r--r--",
    "size": 2297,
    "name": "go.sum"
  },
  ...
]
```
